EEW Report Cards analyze and present data on violations of environmental laws, inspections of polluting facilities, and enforcement actions by the EPA. So far, we’ve generated reports for the congressional districts of each Representative on the House Energy and Commerce Committee (E&C), and for the state of each Senator on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW). These two committees are responsible for oversight of the EPA, an agency with a congressional mandate to enforce environmental laws. Our goal is to shed light on the chronic and routine violations of environmental laws and the failure of EPA to enforce them.
