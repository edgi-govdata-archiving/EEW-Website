**Environmental Enforcement Watch (EEW)** is a collaborative project across [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](http://www.envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI) working groups. The EEW project builds on EDGI’s 2019 Sheep in the Closet report that documents large declines in EPA enforcement of environmental laws. It is also inspired by the [Open Water Data project](http://datalanterns.com/), which visualized Clean Water Act violations with floating lanterns in a community art event developed by EDGI co-founder Sara Wylie, Laura Perovich, and the environmental justice organization GreenRoots. Both projects used data from EPA’s [Enforcement and Compliance History Online](https://echo.epa.gov/) (ECHO) database. They revealed how useful ECHO could be for communities to track pollution and EPA responses in their areas. However, they also revealed the inaccessibility of ECHO for non-specialists, along with many omissions, errors, and confusions present in the data itself. The EEW workshops aim to make ECHO data more readily accessible and meaningful for impacted communities while highlighting how ECHO data can be improved.

## EEW Data Tools & Workshop Structure
ECHO includes compliance data on air, water, and hazardous waste laws for all facilities permitted to emit, store, and use hazardous materials along with data on inspections and enforcement actions taken by EPA and state agencies. It is the first database to publicly share federal environmental enforcement data. However, the website itself can be hard for non-specialists to use and understand. To increase ECHO’s public accessibility, the EEW team is developing a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAWoUbsISSV-tFZvASbTDE6KRl6Hkeu4p-N2jpQFmt0/edit?usp=sharing) – collaborative, open-source data analysis tools – so people can use this information from ECHO to make customizable reports on pollution from facilities in areas of interest. 

These reports can include information about EPA inspections of these sites, whether facilities are complying with federal regulations, and if EPA has responded to violations with enforcement actions. We’ve already written the code to generate reports based on the data—during the workshops, participants simply *run* the notebook to generate a report for their area of interest. **No coding or data science experience is needed!**

We are developing Notebooks to generate several different types of reports: analyzing inspections, violations, enforcement actions, and greenhouse gas emissions by zip-code, congressional district, and county; or investigating a facility of concern across regulatory statutes. We are developing other specialized Notebooks, including one about declining enforcement during the COVID-19 crisis, and we will work with partner organizations to make notebooks for questions they want answered. We want to make environmental compliance data more accessible and useful through our Jupyter Notebooks and supplementing the numbers with community stories, compelling data visualizations, and contextual research.

## You Can EEW Too
Importantly, these workshops are not meant to center EDGI or the EEW team. Rather, we hope that every workshop will be co-hosted by one or more partner organizations: community groups, national environmental watchdogs, research hubs, and everything in between. We are here to help you answer pressing questions and create materials and networks that support your advocacy and organizing efforts.

EEW workshops begin with collective report-making through the Jupyter Notebooks, followed by breakout sessions into different tracks (Storytelling, Research and Contextualization, Data Visualization, and Data Science) based on participants’ own skills and interests. The outcomes of the various tracks will then be compiled into a single report that is informative, visually interesting, and oriented toward community action. We strongly encourage and can help facilitate EEW partners in developing other creative demonstrations and outcomes from these workshops.

EEW workshops will help highlight: 

* whether local facilities are violating their permits to emit hazards into air and water
* what companies are emitting – including greenhouse gas emissions
* the public health risks associated with these emissions
* what is and isn’t being tracked 
* errors in environmental data and corporate reporting
* whether EPA has taken any enforcement action

We hope to compile EEW-generated reports, actions, and other outcomes into an interactive map or repository in order to demonstrate the power of collective action and data stewardship in addressing unchecked environmental violence.

## Why Enforcement Matters
The EPA is mandated by Congress to enforce environmental laws. With the EEW workshops, we aim to draw attention to the large gaps in effective enforcement of environmental laws. By mobilizing community expertise, public engagement and education, compelling material evidence, and an ethic of care, we can pressure our elected officials and local industries to put health and justice before power and profit.

According to Cynthia Giles, former Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, over 25% of all registered facilities are regularly in significant violation of their environmental permits across all programs with available compliance data. And, for programs with the most significant health impacts, “significant violation rates of 50-70% are not unusual” ([Harvard Law School](http://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Cynthia-Giles-Part-2-FINAL.pdf)). Significant non-compliance happens when industries emit hazardous pollutants or fail to report emissions over their permit limits for 6+ months consecutively. Non-compliance has always been an issue and has ramped up even further due to the erosion of EPA funding and enforcement under the Trump Administration ([EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/publication/a-sheep-in-the-closet-the-erosion-of-enforcement-at-the-epa/)). Between 2006 and 2018, enforcement funding and staff dropped by 18% and 21% respectively ([EPA]((https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf))). Between 2007 and 2018, both initiated and concluded enforcement actions dropped by more than 50% ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf)). Now more than ever, local regulators and affected communities are unable to hold polluters accountable to longstanding laws. 

Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income communities – among other historically marginalized groups – face disproportionate exposure to hazardous waste sites and polluting industries ([Bullard & Wright](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780896084469)). These industries have undue influence in the writing and development of regulations, leading to emissions standards that are not health-protective ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2019/06/18/pfoa-pfas-teflon-epa-limit/)). Even still, many industrial facilities fail to comply with these insufficient regulations. The financial penalties for doing so represent just a small fraction of their profits in the unlikely case that these penalties are enforced at all. This crisis of non-compliance, coupled with already-inadequate regulations, represents a systematic and deliberate choice to ignore environmental and human health. We aim for EEW workshops to call attention to these systematic gaps in enforcement using available public data from the ECHO website.

## Environmental Data Justice
A lot of the work in EEW stems from EDGI’s work around “Environmental Data Justice,” or EDJ. EDJ promotes the production and use of environmental data to challenge structures of oppression like fascism, racism, heteropatriarchy, and classism. We believe that data should serve communities and not just corporate polluters. We also believe that communities should be able to have more resources for collecting and analyzing environmental data while retaining the power to decide what they can do with it. You can read more about EDJ and find some related readings in the [EDJ Syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7ytnzXWFkluiYE4Pulo_mCHs9jdNpPm8hw83aLU2pg/edit?usp=sharing).

## The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative

![Environmental Data and Governance Initiative logo](./EDGI-logo.png)

EDGI is an international network of over 175 members from more than 80 different academic institutions and non-profits, comprised foremost by grassroots volunteer efforts. Since 2016, EDGI has served as a preeminent watchdog group for federal environmental data, generating international effort to duplicate and monitor repositories of public data that are vital to environmental health research and knowledge.

EDGI’s work has been widely acknowledged, leading to EDGI testifying before Congress on declines in EPA enforcement, and hundreds of mentions in leading national and international media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, Vice News, and CNN.
