EDGI's EEW events engage members of the public in the process of report-making, from delving into the data science and running Jupyter notebooks to sharing stories about their home areas. Over the summer, we co-hosted workshops with the <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/hubs/" target=_blank >Sunrise Movement Boston Hub</a>, as well as a four-part public workshop series dedicated to the completion of [EEW Congressional Report Cards](/reports) for two key committees. In commitment to the principles of EDJ, all of our code and data is available on <a href="https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving" target=_blank >EDGI’s GitHub site</a>, an open-source coding platform.

## You Can EEW Too
Importantly, these workshops are not meant to center EDGI or the EEW team. Rather, we hope that every workshop will be co-hosted by one or more partner organizations: community groups, national environmental watchdogs, research hubs, and everything in between. We are here to help you answer pressing questions and create materials and networks that support your advocacy and organizing efforts.

EEW workshops begin with collective report-making through the Jupyter Notebooks, followed by breakout sessions into different tracks (Storytelling, Research and Contextualization, Data Visualization, and Data Science) based on participants’ own skills and interests. The outcomes of the various tracks will then be compiled into a single report that is informative, visually interesting, and oriented toward community action. We strongly encourage and can help facilitate EEW partners in developing other creative demonstrations and outcomes from these workshops.
