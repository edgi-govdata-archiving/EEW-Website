ECHO includes compliance data on air, water, and hazardous waste laws for all facilities permitted to emit, store, and use hazardous materials along with data on inspections and enforcement actions taken by EPA and state agencies. It is the first database to publicly share federal environmental enforcement data. However, the website itself can be hard for non-specialists to use and understand. To increase ECHO’s public accessibility, the EEW team is developing a series of Jupyter Notebooks – collaborative, open-source data analysis tools – so people can use this information from ECHO to make customizable reports on pollution from facilities in areas of interest.

These reports can include information about EPA inspections, whether facilities are complying with federal regulations, and if EPA has responded to violations with enforcement actions. We’ve already written the code to generate reports based on the data—during the workshops, participants simply run the notebook to generate the data for their area of interest. No coding or data science experience is needed!

We’ve already developed Notebooks that generate several different types of report metrics. One gathers data on facility inspections, violations, and enforcement actions for three different regulatory statutes (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act" target=_blank >CAA</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act" target=_blank >CWA</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act" target=_blank >RCRA</a>) at the zip-code, congressional district, and county level. Another allows users to investigate a specific facility of concern across the same three regulatory statutes. A specialized notebook was developed to analyze declining enforcement during the COVID-19 crisis, in order to supplement <a href="https://envirodatagov.org/more-permission-to-pollute-the-decline-of-epa-enforcement-and-industry-compliance-during-covid/" target=_blank >EDGI’s COVID Enforcement Report</a>. We can work with partner organizations to specialize notebooks for questions they want answered. We want to make environmental compliance data more accessible and useful through our Jupyter Notebooks and supplementing the numbers with community stories, compelling data visualizations, and contextual research.

<big>Together, we can use publicly available data to hold our government and industry accountable.</big>
