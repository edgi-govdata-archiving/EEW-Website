# Notebooks

EEW's collection of publicly accessible Jupyter Notebooks are designed to help you ask questions beyond what's provided in our reports. Use these to generate graphs and interactive maps relevant to your geographies and questions!

The Notebooks are designed to be accessible to people with **no coding experience**â€” so feel free to dive in, try a [tutorial](/learn/tutorials), or [get in touch](/about/contact) if you want a bit more help!
