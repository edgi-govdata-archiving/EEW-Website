# External Resources

EEW's work draws on open datasets provided by the U.S. federal governmentâ€” but
our work only scratches the surface! Below we list a collection of open federal
data tools and resources relevant to various aspects of environmental governance,
including health and toxics; air and surface quality water, and much more, for
you to delve deeper. (Descriptions below are typically drawn from the sites themselves.)

Is there a dataset that you would especially like to see us incorporate into our
work? Please [let us know!](/about/contact)

<div className='row'>
  {
    ExternalResourcesData.resources.map(resource =>
      <InfoCard
        title = {resource.Name}
        description={resource.Description}
        link={resource.Link}
      />
    )
  }
</div>
