It is also inspired by the Open Water Data project, which visualizes Clean Water Act violations with floating lanterns in a community art event developed by EDGI co-founder Sara Wylie, Laura Perovich, and the environmental justice organization GreenRoots. Both projects use data from the EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database, demonstrating how useful ECHO can be for communities to track pollution and EPA responses in their areas. However, the projects also reveal ECHO's inaccessibility for non-specialists, along with many omissions, errors, and confusions present in the data itself. EEW aims to make ECHO data more readily accessible and meaningful for impacted communities while highlighting how ECHO data can be improved.`}</p>\n      <img src={EEWLogo} className='section-break-image' alt='EEW Logo' />\n      <h2>{`Our Goals`}</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Draw large-scale public attention to the lack of environmental enforcement.`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Work with partner organizations, especially marginalized communities, to build data efficacy through mutually beneficial relationships`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Inform EPA visions of alternative forms of public engagement`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Prototype community-oriented structures for environmental data, i.e. by congressional district, watershed, and health risks for a community`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Bring attention to the relationship between environmental enforcement, environmental racism, and other interlocking forms of oppression (particularly white supremacy, capitalism, settler-colonialism, heteropatriarchy, etc.)`}</li>\n      </ul>\n      <img src={EDGILogo} alt='Environmental Data and Governance Initiative logo' />\n      <h2>{`The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative`}</h2>\n      <p>{`EDGI is an international network of over 175 members from more than 80 different academic institutions and non-profits, comprised primarily of grassroots volunteer efforts.

EDJ promotes the production and use of environmental data in ways that challenge structures of oppression like fascism, racism, heteropatriarchy, and classism. We believe that data should serve communities and not just corporate polluters. We also believe that communities should have more resources for collecting and analyzing environmental data while retaining the power to decide what they do with it.
