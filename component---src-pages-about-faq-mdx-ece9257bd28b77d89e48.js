APE is a website for everyone—the public, students, activists, journalists—to understand the Environmental Protection Agency's national and global importance. Since its creation in 1970, Congress has charged the agency with implementing laws that protect us from air pollution, dirty water, and hazardous waste, among other things. This process is complex. Our website provides a straightforward history of the agency, explains how it operates, and provides the data and tools for you to explore and track the EPA in greater depth. This is an ongoing project of the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative.
