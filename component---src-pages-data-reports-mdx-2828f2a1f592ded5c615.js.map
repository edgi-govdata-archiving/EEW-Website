By mobilizing community expertise, public engagement and education, compelling material evidence, and an ethic of care, we can pressure our elected officials and local industries to put health and justice before power and profit.`}</p>\n      <p>{`According to Cynthia Giles, former Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, over 25% of all registered facilities are regularly in significant violation of their environmental permits across all programs with available compliance data. And, for programs with the most significant health impacts, “significant violation rates of 50-70% are not unusual” (`}<a href=\"http://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Cynthia-Giles-Part-2-FINAL.pdf\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`Harvard Law School`}</a>{`). Significant non-compliance happens when industries emit hazardous pollutants or fail to report emissions over their permit limits for 6+ months consecutively. Non-compliance has always been an issue and has ramped up even further due to the erosion of EPA funding and enforcement under the Trump Administration (`}<a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/publication/a-sheep-in-the-closet-the-erosion-of-enforcement-at-the-epa/\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`EDGI`}</a>{`). Between 2006 and 2018, enforcement funding and staff dropped by 18% and 21% respectively (`}<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`EPA`}</a>{`). Between 2007 and 2018, both initiated and concluded enforcement actions dropped by more than 50% (`}<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`EPA`}</a>{`). Now more than ever, local regulators and affected communities are unable to hold polluters accountable to longstanding laws.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income communities—among other historically marginalized groups—face disproportionate exposure to hazardous waste sites and polluting industries (`}<a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780896084469\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`Bullard & Wright`}</a>{`). These industries have undue influence in the writing and development of regulations, leading to emissions standards that are not health-protective (`}<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/18/pfoa-pfas-teflon-epa-limit/\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>{`The Intercept`}</a>{`). Even still, many industrial facilities fail to comply with these insufficient regulations. The financial penalties for doing so represent just a small fraction of their profits in the unlikely case that these penalties are enforced at all. This crisis of non-compliance, coupled with already-inadequate regulations, represents a systematic and deliberate choice to ignore environmental and human health. We aim for EEW workshops to call attention to these systematic gaps in enforcement using available public data from the ECHO website.`}</p>\n      <h2>{`Contributors`}</h2>\n      <img src={EEWAuthorshipImage} className='full-width-image' alt=\"Diagram listing the names of core contributors on the EEW project, arranged by fields of care (data care, external care, event care, internal care, and research care\" />\n    </Layout>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","pageTitle","sidebarLinks","DataPageSidebarLinks","activeHeaderLink","Link","to","className","href","target","rel","src","Map","alt","height","width","parentName","reportData","SenateEnvironmentAndPublicWorksCommitteeData","reportTitle","HouseEnergyAndCommerceCommittee","CycleDiagram","EEWAuthorshipImage","isMDXComponent","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
